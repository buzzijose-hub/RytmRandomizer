# RytmRandomizer Passive Architecture Summary

Date: May 4, 2026

Current branch:

modularize-v1.34

Current HEAD:

043912f

## Protected Reference

`rytm_hybrid_randomizer_v134.py` remains the protected V1.34 behavior
reference. It must not be edited during passive scaffold, lookup, reporting, or
documentation work.

## Current Closeout Suite

The standard closeout suite currently includes:

- scaffold
- validation
- inspection
- preview
- audit
- profile lookup
- scene lookup
- command lookup
- registry

The closeout workflow also checks:

- `git diff -- rytm_hybrid_randomizer_v134.py`
- `git status --short`

## Passive Lookup Helpers

Current passive lookup helpers:

- `rytm_randomizer/profile_lookup.py`
- `rytm_randomizer/scene_lookup.py`
- `rytm_randomizer/command_lookup.py`

## Unified Passive Registry View

`rytm_randomizer/registry.py` exposes a unified read-only registry view over the
currently scaffolded passive metadata surfaces.

Current registry sections:

- commands
- scenes
- group_profiles

It exposes:

- copied registry data
- copied section data
- copied item metadata
- passive not-found behavior for unknown sections
- passive not-found behavior for unknown items
- a passive section/count summary

It is intended for:

- inspection
- reporting
- preview
- documentation
- future UI work

It does not:

- execute commands
- dispatch commands
- send MIDI
- open ports
- mutate state or hardware
- write SysEx
- add GUI behavior
- add capture behavior
- add Analog Four support
- add Pads 5-12 support

The registry view returns copied data so callers cannot mutate source metadata.

### Profile Lookup

`rytm_randomizer/profile_lookup.py` exposes read-only lookup helpers for the
existing V1.34 `GROUP_PROFILE_METADATA` entries.

It exposes:

- existing group profile keys
- passive profile descriptions
- machine values for existing group profile keys
- group pad values for existing group profile keys
- passive not-found behavior for unknown keys
- copied metadata to prevent source mutation

It does not:

- add new profiles
- add new machines
- add new MIDI mappings
- add Pads 5-12
- execute commands
- dispatch runtime behavior
- send MIDI or open ports

### Scene Lookup

`rytm_randomizer/scene_lookup.py` exposes read-only lookup helpers for the
existing V1.34 `SCENE_COMMANDS` metadata.

It exposes:

- existing scene keys
- passive scene descriptions
- scene names
- scene action metadata as data only
- passive not-found behavior for unknown keys
- copied metadata to prevent source mutation

It does not:

- execute scene actions
- dispatch scene commands
- treat action metadata as callable behavior
- send MIDI or open ports
- mutate state or hardware
- add Pads 5-12

### Command Lookup

`rytm_randomizer/command_lookup.py` exposes read-only lookup helpers for the
existing V1.34 `COMMANDS` metadata.

It exposes:

- existing command keys
- passive command descriptions
- command type metadata
- command label or scene name metadata
- passive not-found behavior for unknown keys
- copied metadata to prevent source mutation

It does not:

- execute commands
- dispatch commands
- add handlers, callables, callbacks, or runtime hooks
- treat metadata fields as executable behavior
- send MIDI or open ports
- mutate state or hardware
- add Pads 5-12

## Current Safety Boundaries

Current modularization work remains behind these boundaries:

- no MIDI
- no ports
- no runtime dispatch
- no command execution
- no hardware mutation
- no SysEx writes
- no GUI
- no capture
- no Analog Four
- no Pads 5-12

## Recommended Next Passive Layers

Recommended passive layers before runtime work:

- passive report generator
- passive CLI preview only if it does not dispatch or send MIDI

These layers should continue to return passive data only and must not wire into
runtime command execution.

## Conditions Before Hardware-Facing Work

Before any hardware-facing layer is considered, the project should require:

- V1.34 behavior parity plan
- explicit dry-run mode
- isolated MIDI adapter
- no automatic port opening
- manual user confirmation before hardware send
- tests proving no accidental execution
