# RytmRandomizer Passive Architecture Summary

Date: May 4, 2026

Current branch:

modularize-v1.34

Current HEAD:

915b7a2

## Protected Reference

`rytm_hybrid_randomizer_v134.py` remains the protected V1.34 behavior
reference. It must not be edited during passive scaffold, lookup, reporting, or
documentation work.

## Current Closeout Suite

The standard closeout suite currently includes:

- scaffold
- validation
- inspection
- preview
- audit
- profile lookup
- scene lookup
- command lookup
- registry
- registry report
- registry report CLI

The closeout workflow also checks:

- `git diff -- rytm_hybrid_randomizer_v134.py`
- `git status --short`

## Passive Lookup Helpers

Current passive lookup helpers:

- `rytm_randomizer/profile_lookup.py`
- `rytm_randomizer/scene_lookup.py`
- `rytm_randomizer/command_lookup.py`

## Unified Passive Registry View

`rytm_randomizer/registry.py` exposes a unified read-only registry view over the
currently scaffolded passive metadata surfaces.

Current registry sections:

- commands
- scenes
- group_profiles

It exposes:

- copied registry data
- copied section data
- copied item metadata
- passive not-found behavior for unknown sections
- passive not-found behavior for unknown items
- a passive section/count summary

It is intended for:

- inspection
- reporting
- preview
- documentation
- future UI work

It does not:

- execute commands
- dispatch commands
- send MIDI
- open ports
- mutate state or hardware
- write SysEx
- add GUI behavior
- add capture behavior
- add Analog Four support
- add Pads 5-12 support

The registry view returns copied data so callers cannot mutate source metadata.

## Passive Registry Report Generator

`rytm_randomizer/registry_report.py` sits on top of the unified passive registry
view and generates in-memory, read-only report data.

It reports:

- registry sections
- per-section item counts
- known sections: commands, scenes, group_profiles
- passive safety boundary summary
- unsupported scope summary
- active behavior status

The formatted report is intended for:

- inspection
- documentation
- future UI work
- future CLI preview work

It does not:

- write report files
- create a CLI command
- print during import
- execute commands
- dispatch commands
- send MIDI
- open ports
- mutate state or hardware
- write SysEx
- add GUI behavior
- add capture behavior
- add Analog Four support
- add Pads 5-12 support
- expand the machine/profile universe

### Passive Registry Report CLI Preview

The passive registry report CLI preview adds the first user-facing read-only
command for displaying the passive registry report:

```powershell
python -m rytm_randomizer.registry_report
```

It uses:

- `rytm_randomizer/registry_report.py`
- `tests/test_registry_report_cli.py`
- `Scripts/closeout_check.ps1`

It does:

- print the existing golden-format passive registry report to stdout
- exit with code 0
- preserve the registry report golden text contract
- require no hardware

It does not:

- print during import
- write report files
- open MIDI ports
- send MIDI
- dispatch commands
- execute commands
- mutate runtime state
- mutate hardware state
- write SysEx
- add GUI behavior
- add capture behavior
- add Analog Four support
- add Pads 5-12 support
- expand the machine/profile universe

Analog Rytm and Analog Four are not needed and should remain off for this phase.

### Registry Report Golden Text Contract

The registry report golden text contract locks down the formatted passive
registry report output.

It uses:

- `tests/test_registry_report.py`
- `tests/fixtures/registry_report_expected.txt`

Purpose:

- keep the formatted report deterministic
- provide snapshot-style golden text coverage
- make future CLI, UI, and reporting work safer
- normalize line endings so Windows CRLF/LF differences do not cause false failures

Closeout already includes registry report testing, so no duplicate closeout
entry was needed.

It does not:

- add CLI behavior
- write report files at runtime
- print during import
- execute commands
- dispatch commands
- send MIDI
- open ports
- mutate state or hardware
- write SysEx
- add GUI behavior
- add capture behavior
- add Analog Four support
- add Pads 5-12 support
- expand the machine/profile universe

### Profile Lookup

`rytm_randomizer/profile_lookup.py` exposes read-only lookup helpers for the
existing V1.34 `GROUP_PROFILE_METADATA` entries.

It exposes:

- existing group profile keys
- passive profile descriptions
- machine values for existing group profile keys
- group pad values for existing group profile keys
- passive not-found behavior for unknown keys
- copied metadata to prevent source mutation

It does not:

- add new profiles
- add new machines
- add new MIDI mappings
- add Pads 5-12
- execute commands
- dispatch runtime behavior
- send MIDI or open ports

### Scene Lookup

`rytm_randomizer/scene_lookup.py` exposes read-only lookup helpers for the
existing V1.34 `SCENE_COMMANDS` metadata.

It exposes:

- existing scene keys
- passive scene descriptions
- scene names
- scene action metadata as data only
- passive not-found behavior for unknown keys
- copied metadata to prevent source mutation

It does not:

- execute scene actions
- dispatch scene commands
- treat action metadata as callable behavior
- send MIDI or open ports
- mutate state or hardware
- add Pads 5-12

### Command Lookup

`rytm_randomizer/command_lookup.py` exposes read-only lookup helpers for the
existing V1.34 `COMMANDS` metadata.

It exposes:

- existing command keys
- passive command descriptions
- command type metadata
- command label or scene name metadata
- passive not-found behavior for unknown keys
- copied metadata to prevent source mutation

It does not:

- execute commands
- dispatch commands
- add handlers, callables, callbacks, or runtime hooks
- treat metadata fields as executable behavior
- send MIDI or open ports
- mutate state or hardware
- add Pads 5-12

## Current Safety Boundaries

Current modularization work remains behind these boundaries:

- no MIDI
- no ports
- no runtime dispatch
- no command execution
- no hardware mutation
- no SysEx writes
- no GUI
- no capture
- no Analog Four
- no Pads 5-12

## Recommended Next Passive Layers

Recommended passive layers before runtime work:

- passive CLI preview only if it does not dispatch or send MIDI

These layers should continue to return passive data only and must not wire into
runtime command execution.

## Passive Report CLI Preview Plan

`Docs/PASSIVE_REPORT_CLI_PREVIEW_PLAN.md` defined the read-only CLI
preview/report command concept before implementation. The implemented passive
CLI preview now follows that plan.

Potential future command shapes include:

- `python -m rytm_randomizer.registry_report`
- `python -m rytm_randomizer.cli report`

The command only formats and displays the already-passive registry report. It is
useful for inspection, documentation, future UI, and future safe operator
workflows.

The plan requires that any future CLI preview preserve:

- the passive registry report generator boundary
- the registry report golden text contract
- no import-time printing
- no report file writing by default
- no hardware requirement

It prohibits:

- MIDI sending
- MIDI port opening
- command dispatch
- command execution
- hardware mutation
- SysEx
- GUI behavior
- capture behavior
- Analog Four support
- Pads 5-12 support
- machine/profile universe expansion

## Conditions Before Hardware-Facing Work

Before any hardware-facing layer is considered, the project should require:

- V1.34 behavior parity plan
- explicit dry-run mode
- isolated MIDI adapter
- no automatic port opening
- manual user confirmation before hardware send
- tests proving no accidental execution
